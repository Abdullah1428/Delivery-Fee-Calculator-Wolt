# Wolt Coding Assignment - Delivery Fee Calculator

## Task
A delivery fee calculator. This code is needed when a customer is ready with their shopping cart and weâ€™d like to show them how much the delivery will cost. The delivery price depends on the cart value, the amount of the items in the cart, the time of the order, and the delivery distance.

## Tech Stack
### React "^17.0.2"<br/>
### Typescript "^4.1.2" <br/>
### Bootstraps (for styling)

### @testing-library/react-hooks "^7.0.2" (for custom hooks testing)<br/>

## To run the project
Unzip the folder and open it in your editor <br />
In the project directory, run following commands:

### `yarn install`

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## To run the test

To run tests, run the following command in project directory.

### `yarn test`

## TASK Development
For developing the task React, Typescript, React Context and Bootstraps have been used. The code can be improved in alot of ways as some repeating code will be found in the project so its not perfect and can be refactored but for the sake of this task I thought this will be better enough. The tests for the task can also be written in more better way like adding support for context providers in test.
